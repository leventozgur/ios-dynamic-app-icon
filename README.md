# iOS Dynamic App Icon

This iOS application has been designed to showcase how the application icon can be dynamically changed. The application employs a method to change the image used to create the application icon.

## How it works

When the application is launched, the application icon is set to a default icon. The application has three AppIcons added to it, and these icons are stored under Assets. Clicking on the **"Change App Icon"** button will sequentially change the application icon. The icon names in the Info.plist file are used to switch between different AppIcons.

## Installation

This application was created using Xcode 14.2. You can download the project and build it directly.
